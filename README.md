# Python Garden Projects

Welcome to the Python Garden Projects! 🌱 These two projects explore Python programming through the engaging lens of community garden management. Whether you are learning Python fundamentals or diving into object-oriented design, these exercises provide a hands-on approach to developing coding skills while modeling real-world systems.

## Project 1: CodeCultivation — Object-Oriented Garden Systems

**Version:** 1.0  
**Summary:** Build a comprehensive digital garden ecosystem while learning advanced Python concepts. Manage community gardens efficiently through data-driven approaches using classes, inheritance, and analytics.

### Overview
CodeCultivation focuses on advanced Python programming and object-oriented design. Through a series of exercises, you will create a full garden management system that simulates plant growth, organizes garden data, and analyzes complex garden networks.

### Key Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, inheritance, super(), and encapsulation  
- Data modeling: Plant classes, specialized plant types, and garden networks  
- Data integrity: Validation and secure access to plant data  
- System design: Organizing large-scale, modular Python applications  
- Analytics: Using nested helper classes and different method types (instance, class, static)  

### Exercises
1. **Planting Your First Seed** — Learn how Python programs execute (`ft_garden_intro.py`)  
2. **Garden Data Organizer** — Store and display multiple plants efficiently (`ft_garden_data.py`)  
3. **Plant Growth Simulator** — Simulate plant growth over time (`ft_plant_growth.py`)  
4. **Plant Factory** — Quickly create multiple plants with initial values (`ft_plant_factory.py`)  
5. **Garden Security System** — Protect plant data with secure setter/getter methods (`ft_garden_security.py`)  
6. **Specialized Plant Types** — Implement flowers, trees, and vegetables with inheritance (`ft_plant_types.py`)  
7. **Garden Analytics Platform** — Build a comprehensive analytics system for multiple gardens (`ft_garden_analytics.py`)  

### Usage
Run each exercise individually using Python 3.10+. Each file is self-contained and demonstrates the requested functionality.

## Project 2: Growing Code — Python Fundamentals Through Garden Data

**Version:** 1.0  
**Summary:** Learn Python basics through community garden data. Understand expressions, variables, functions, and control flow while contributing to sustainable initiatives.

### Overview
Growing Code introduces Python fundamentals using practical exercises. Each exercise focuses on building a specific function related to garden data, allowing learners to practice core concepts like input/output, loops, conditionals, and type annotations.

### Key Concepts
- Core Python syntax: Variables, expressions, input/output, and control flow  
- Functions: Writing and testing Python functions  
- Iteration and recursion: Repeating tasks efficiently  
- Type hints: Improving code readability and correctness  
- Real-world applications: Modeling garden data for meaningful outputs  

### Exercises
1. **Hello Garden** — Print a welcome message (`ft_hello_garden.py`)  
2. **Garden Plot Area** — Calculate the area of a plot (`ft_plot_area.py`)  
3. **Harvest Total** — Compute the total harvest over multiple days (`ft_harvest_total.py`)  
4. **Plant Age Check** — Determine if a plant is ready to harvest (`ft_plant_age.py`)  
5. **Water Reminder** — Alert if plants need watering (`ft_water_reminder.py`)  
6. **Count to Harvest** — Count days iteratively and recursively (`ft_count_harvest_iterative.py`, `ft_count_harvest_recursive.py`)  
7. **Garden Summary** — Display a garden summary (`ft_garden_summary.py`)  
8. **Seed Inventory with Type Annotations** — Track seeds with types (`ft_seed_inventory.py`)  

### Usage
Each exercise is designed as a standalone function. Test functions using the provided `main.py` helper file. Compatible with Python 3.10+ and flake8-compliant.

## General Guidelines

- Python 3.10+ is required.  
- Follow PEP8 coding standards (flake8).  
- Use proper naming conventions: PascalCase for classes, snake_case for functions and variables.  
- Include docstrings and type hints where appropriate.
- Submit only the requested files for evaluation.
